# Rust's Module System Explained!

- Rust has a module system, that starts with a package, (when `cargo new` you create a new package), a package stores crates. 
    - a crate could either be a binary crate or a library crate.  crates contain modules.
    - modules allow you to organize a chunk of code and control the privacy rules.

## Crates

- rust follows the convention that if you have `main.cs` defined in your source directory, then a binary crate with the same name as your package will be automatically created.
    - and the `main.rs` will be the crate root.
- and there's also a similar convention for library crate, if the `lib.rs` was found, then rust will automatically create a library crate with the same name as your package.
- so even though we don't have any crates defined in `cargo.toml`, our package may actually have 2 crates.

### Some Crate Rules

1. a package must have at least one crate.
2. a package could have either 0 or 1 library crate.
3. a package could have any number of binary crates.
    - if we want multiple binary crate, we would create a folder called `bin`, and in this folder we can add another file. and each file in this folder will represent another binary crate.

## Modules

> you can create a module with or without inline body.

> A module without a body is loaded from an external file. When the module does not have a path attribute, the path to the file mirrors the logical module path. 


- Each file in Rust (besides main.rs or lib.rs) corresponds to one module in a crate (main.rs and lib.rs are the crate's root). 
- To create a module, you add this line to its parent module (or to lib.rs or main.rs, which makes it a submodule under the crate)
    ```rust
    mod somemod;
    ```
- Then, you have 2 options:
    1. Add a file called `somemod.rs` in the same folder as the file where you put that `mod somemod;` declaration. 
        ```bash
        |
        +---main.rs
        +---somemod.rs
        +---somemod  # you can have sub module
            |
            +---anothermod.rs
        ```
    2. or add a folder called `somemod` in the same folder as the file with the `mod somemod;` declaration. 
        > Prior to rustc 1.30, using mod.rs files was the way to load a module with nested children
        ```bash
        |
        +---main.rs
        +---somemod
            |
            +---mod.rs
        ```
