# Week 4  Machine Language

<h2 id="d14ae9a46f5db30f2e3671e3260bad56"></h2>

## 4.1 Overview

- elements 
    - Operation : how are we going to specify the instructions ? 
    - Program Counter: how do we know which instruction to perform at any given stage and time ?
    - Addressing : have to tell the hardware what to operate on.


<h2 id="e7e3a5617750708cf2c2d2bd66835df3"></h2>

### Mnemonics

![](../imgs/n2t_mlang_mnemonics.png)

- Interpretation 1: The "symbolic form" doesn't really exist but is just a convenient mnemonic to present machine language instructions to humans. 
- Interpretation 2: We will allow humans to write machine language instructions using this "*assembly language*" and will have an "Assembler" program convert it to the bit-form.


<h2 id="7572d5e2c2cbff0b74dffe9eb8f946af"></h2>

## 4.2 Machine Languages : Elements

- Specification of the Hardware/Software Interface
    - What are the supported operations ?
    - What do they operate on ?
    - How is the program controlled ?
- Usually is close correspondence to actual Hardware Architecture
    - Not necessarily so
- Cost-Performance Tradeoff
    - Silicon Area
    - Time to Complete Instruction

<h2 id="90c98ad75c6e684802b11191a6ee1e48"></h2>

### Machine Language : Operations 

- Each machine language defines a set of operations
- Those operations usually correspond to what's implemented in Hardware
    - Arithmetic Operations: add, subtract, ...
    - Logical Operations: and , or , ...
    - Flow Control : "goto instruction X", "if C ten goto instruction Y" 
- Differences between machine languages 
    - Richness of the set of operations ( divisions? bulk copy? ... )
    - Data types ( width, floating point, ...  )

<h2 id="b00adf6a12808f6581dab31c33b53648"></h2>

### Machine Language : Addressing 

- Accessing a memory location is exprensive
    - Need to supply a long address
    - Getting the memory contents into the CPU take time 
        - 从内存取值到CPU ，和CPU本身做算数运算相比，要花费非常多的时间
- Solution: Memory Hierachy

![](../imgs/n2t_memory_hierarchy.png)

- Faster access means smaller memory size

<h2 id="a9682ea50df45368189078864618a7cd"></h2>

#### Registers

- CPUs usually contain a few , easily accessed "registers"
- Their number and functions are are a central part of the machine language
- Data Register
    - Add R1, R2
        - R1:10 , R2:20, result 30
- Address Registers
    - Store R1, @A 
        - A:137 , means store R1's value (say 77)  to Mem[137]
        - Mem[137] = 77

<h2 id="011ddc58d58d2714f6ab1823a833a279"></h2>

#### Addressing Modes

- Register 
    - Add R1, R2     // R2 <- R2 + R1
- Direct 
    - Add R1, M[200]  // Mem[200] <- M[200] + R1
- Indirect
    - Add R1, @A      // Mem[A] <- Mem[A] + R1
- Immediate 
    - Add 73 , R1     // R1 <- R1 + 73

<h2 id="6a8b3c75d2b148310a110bf194c67f26"></h2>

#### Input / Output

- Many types of Input and Output Devices
    - keyboard, mouse, camera , sensors, printers, screen, speaker, ...
- CPU needs some kind of protocal to talk to each of them
    - Software "Drivers" know these protocols
- One general method of interaction use "memory mapping"
    - Memory Location 12345 holds the direction of the last movement of the mouse
    - Memory Location 45678 is not a real memory location but a way to tell the printer which paper to use.
   
<h2 id="785a7f6de7d8cc20365a065384792be0"></h2>

### Machine Language : Flow Control 

- Usually the CPU executes machine instructions in sequence
- Sometimes we need to "jump" unconditionally to another location, e.g. loop
- Sometimes we need to jump only if some condition is met

<h2 id="bb308f6cd7b0bcbd8347e07247272ed7"></h2>

## 4.3 The Hack Computer and Machine Language 

<h2 id="59440b54dcccb2580f829b511a3ab454"></h2>

### Hack computer : hardware 

![](../imgs/n2t_hack_compute_archi.png)

- A 16-bit machine means  the atomic unit of operation is 16-bit. 
- A 16-bit machine consising of :
    - Data memory (RAM): a sequence of 16-bit registers:
        - RAM[0], RAM[1], RAM[2] , ... 
    - Instruction memory(ROM): a sequence of 16-bit register:
        - ROM[0], ROM[1], ROM[2] , ...
    - Central Processing Unit (CPU): preforms 16-bit instrcutions
        - using mostly the ALU which resides inside the CPU.
    - Instruction bus / data bus / address bus

- How do we control the computer ?
    - Software !
- Hack machine language :
    - 16-bit A-instructions
    - 16-bit C-instructions

![](../imgs/n2t_hack_computer_archi2.png)

- Control:
    - The ROM is loaded with a Hack program
    - The *reset* button is pushed
    - The program starts running

<h2 id="6bccf7c3f8c59b04ccbc9be6a8917a0f"></h2>

### Hack computer: registers 

![](../imgs/n2t_hack_computer_register.png)

- The Hack machine language recognizes 3 registers :
    - D holds a 16-bit value : data
    - A holds a 16-bit value : data or address
    - M represents the 16-bit RAM register addressed by A


<h2 id="7a47f762af8bb05b5c4b7663c365bbdc"></h2>

### The A-instruction

- Syntax : `@value`
- Where *value* is either:
    - a non-negative decimal constant , or
    - a symbol referring to such a constant (later)
- Semantics:
    - Sets the A register to *value*
    - Side effect: RAM[A] becomes the selected RAM register 
        - very important side effect , once set, 
        - it automatically selectes a particular register from the data memory , what we called M.
- Example :  `@21`     
    - Effect:
        - Sets the A register to 21
        - RAM[21] becomes the selected RAM register 

-  Usage example 

```
// Set RAM[100] to -1
@100   // A=100
M=-1   // RAM[100] = -1
```

- so we always have to address the memory by using an A instruction. 

<h2 id="2656df8b06102adadd0f4e8d28ca7d3b"></h2>

### The C-instruction

- the workhorse of the language 
- that's where most of the action takes place and the syntax of this instruction consists of 3 different fields 
    - desination
    - computation
    - jump directive

```
dest = comp ; jump  // both dest and jump are optional
```

- here is how it works:
    - First of all ,we compute something 
    - and then we do one of two things. 
        - we can either store the result of computation in some destination ,
        - or we can use this computation to decide if we want to jump to some other instruction in the program.

![](../imgs/n2t_c_instruction_comp.png)
        
dest = `null, M, D, MD, A, AM, AD, AMD`

- we can store it simultaneously both in  M , and D

jump = `null, JGT, JEQ, JGE, JLT, JNE, JLE, JMP`

- those 8 possible conditions , they always compare the result of the computation to **zero**.
- Semantics:
    - Compute the value of *comp*
    - Store the result in *dest*
    - if the Boolean expression (comp *jump* 0) is true , 
        - jumps to execute the instruction stored in ROM[A].
- Example:

```
// set the D regist to -1
D = -1

// set RAM[300] to the value of D-1
@300  // A=300
M=D-1

// if (D-1==0) jump to execute the instrction stored in ROM[56]
@56
D-1; JEQ  //  if (D-1 EQ 0) Jump to 56
```

<h2 id="8bfeef857873fbe94ceeca536b8ba8df"></h2>

### 为什么要划分 A/C 两套 指令？

- Hack 是16bit 系统
- 一条指令要处理 dest comp jump 3部分，没有足够 bit 处理 大的整数，或地址
- 所以分出了单独的 A instruction， 可以处理15bit的整数 或 地址

<h2 id="07f3d75ea1037290fb379184f55486ac"></h2>

## 4.4 Hack Language Specification 

<h2 id="a74da8b3478acd4a7ca3b8c93f7a0d15"></h2>

### The A-instruction: symbolic and binary syntax

- Symbolic syntax :
    - `@value` 
    - i.e. `@21`
- Binary syntax:
    - `0value`
    - where the *value* is a 15-bit binary number
    - i.e.  ***0***00000000010101

<h2 id="fb409005082bcbc783a0b8c36745ee7a"></h2>

### The C-instruction: symbolic and binary syntax


- Symbolic syntax :
    - `dest = comp ; jump ` 

--- 


![](../imgs/n2t_c_instruction_binary_syntax.png)

- Binary syntax :
    - 
    - op code: 1 means a C-instruction, while 0 means an A-instruction
    - comp bit: to specify what computation to achieve. 
        - these are the control bits that will be sent later to the ALU  (ALU 不是6位 control bits 吗 ?)
        
![](../imgs/n2t_c_binary_comp.png)

- impossible to compute with A and M !!

![](../imgs/n2t_c_binary_dest.png)

- d1 means writing to A enable
- d2 means D 
- d3 means M 

![](../imgs/n2t_c_binary_jump.png)

- j1 means less than 0
- j2 means equals 0
- j3 means great than 0

---

<h2 id="3ee61240a785681403c329e4721faa17"></h2>

## 4.5 Input/Output 

<h2 id="88654d0d30b3eafe4fcc2c9fc29c0a7f"></h2>

### Hack Computer platform: Output 

![](../imgs/n2t_screen_mem_map.png)

- Screen Memroy Map
    - A designated memory area, dedicated to manager a display unit
    - The physical display is continuously *refreshed* from the memory map, many times per second
    - Output is effected by writing code that manipulates the screen memory map.

-  Display Unit
    - ![](../imgs/n2t_display_unit_hack.png)
    - use a bit that represents the pixel in screen memory map
    - so we need 8k, 16-bit words : `8*1024*16 = 256*512 = 131072`
- we are going to implement the screen memory map using a 8k chip called Screen.
- To set pixel (row,col) on/off:
    1. word = Screen[ 32 \* row + col/16 ]   , or
        - word = RAM[ 16384 + 32 \* row + col/16 ]  // 假设 Screen base address 为16384
    2. Set the (col%16)th bit of work to 0 or 1.
    3. commit *word* to the RAM 

<h2 id="4bdb00d0e3d6c18d3f264fd18717ff21"></h2>

### Hack computer platform: Input

- The physical keyboard is associated with a *keyboard memory map.*
    - like the scrren memory map, it is a part of RAM
- The keyboard memory map is a single 16-bit register, which is called *keyboard*
- When a key is pressed on the keyboard , the key's *scan code* appears in the *keyboard memory map*.

- The Hack character set :
    - it is a subset of the keys that you have on you regular keyboard.

![](../imgs/n2t_hack_character_set.png)

- To check which key is currently pressed: 
    - Probe the contents of the `keyboard` chip
    - In the Hack computer: probe the contents of RAM[24576].


<h2 id="a18eff3da7a07aee87a273f3fa131a52"></h2>

## 4.6 Hack Programming, Part1

<h2 id="43ac21454f5d3b1ba15c3c9070c3574b"></h2>

### Working with register and memory

- Typical operations:

```
// D=10
@10
D = A

// D++
D = D+1

// D=RAM[17]
@17
D = M 

// RAM[17] = 10
@10
D=A
@17
M=D

// RAM[5] = RAM[3]
@3
D=M
@5
M=D
```

<h2 id="e4e5a06fdd10851c3e7b7c0c5a04052c"></h2>

### Hack program example: add two numbers

![](../imgs/n2t_hack_program_add2numbers.png)

<h2 id="fa7826a41e60188c3d9aa40c67875a2e"></h2>

### How to terminate a program properly?

- Best practice:
    - To terminate a program safely , end it with an infinite loop.

```
M=D  // RAM[2] =D 

// above is privous code
@6
0; JMP
```

<h2 id="c6485feeba4ed4c45bed624bd9d153e1"></h2>

### Built-in symbols

- The Hack assembly language features *built-in* symbols:

- Virtual Registers
    - when the assembler or the translator sees a label like R3 , 
    - it will replace it with a number 3

symbol | value
--- | ---
R0  |  0
R1  |  1
R2  |  2
... | ...
R15 |  15

![](../imgs/n2t_virtual_register.png)

---

- other built-in symbols

symbol | value
--- | ---
SCREEN | 16384
KBD  |  24576
SP | 0
LCL | 1
ARG | 2
THIS | 3
THAT | 4

- the last 5 symbols are used in the implementation of Hack virtual machine , discussed in N2T part II.


<h2 id="433672a84dd80f224b715113f64d6b2f"></h2>

## 4.7: Hack Programming , Part 2

<h2 id="cec9f877aea82b580a4bd8292d6fd05b"></h2>

### Branching

![](../imgs/n2t_ml_branching.png)

- 这个程序可以很好的工作，但是 如果没有这些 左边的这些行号， 这段代码就是个噩梦
- Fortunately , we have a very nice feature in assembly languages , which called symbolic references. 
    - declare a label :  `( LABEL )`
    - `@LABEL` translates to `@n` , where *n* is the instruction number following the `(LABLE)` declaration.
- Label declarations are not translated ( to machine language ). 
- Each reference to a label is replaced with a reference to the instruction number following that label's declaration.

![](../imgs/n2t_symbolic_reference.png)

<h2 id="03df896fc71cd516fdcf44aa699c4933"></h2>

### Variables

- in the lower level of the Hack machine language , we have only 1 variable type.
- we have only 16-bit values to worry about. 
- we use a single register to represent every one of our variables, if we want to create variables in our program.
- Example: use temp to exchange the content of  R0 and R1

![](../imgs/n2t_variable.png)

- here , `temp` don't have a corresponding label called temp.  how it works ?
- Basically , we present the following pledge to the computer: 
    - Please goto the memory unit, find some available memory register , say register  *n* . 
    - so from now on, each occurance of `@temp` in the program will be translated into `@n`
- Rules:
    - A reference to a symbol that has no corresponding lable declaration is treated as a reference to a variable.
    - Variable are allocated to the RAM from adderss 16 onward. 
        - in this example , we have only 1 variable, so it ends up being allocated to RAM 16.

![](../imgs/n2t_variable_rom.png)

- let's take a look at our program.
- This program has another very nice virtue, which is more subtle. 
- This program is what is known as **relocatable code**.
    - I can take this program , and load it into memory **not necessary to address zero**. 
    - I can put it anywhere I want in memory as long as I remember what is the base address that they used for this program. 
- Once we write this program carefully useing symbolic references, we don't have to worry about where they will be located in memory. 
    - We can write something called **loader** that takes care of this technical detail. 
 
<h2 id="f26bb1b6fe9c2cee3fb09973ed60da69"></h2>

### Iterative processing 

- Example 
    - Compute 1+2+...+n
- how to do ?
    1. write pseudo code 
    2. debug your pseudo code, ensure it works
    3. simply translating from pseudo code to machine language 

<h2 id="0fbcaf38632f1b7a6eb86b99e1e1ea63"></h2>

## 4.8 Hack Programming , Part 3

<h2 id="7bba5d01d3778f550d69f87dca50fc3f"></h2>

### Pointers 

```
// some pseudo code
for(i=0; i<n; i++) {
    arr[i] = -1    
}
// suppose that arr=100 , and n=10
```

- when assembler translate this piece of pseudo code into machine language, the machine language no longer recognizes the array obstruction. 
- As far as the machine language is concerned , the array is just a segment in memory of which we know the base address of this segment and the length of the array.


```
    // arr = 100
    @100
    D=A
    @arr  // 16 ,maybe
    M=D

    // n=10
    @10
    D=A
    @n      // 17
    M=D

    // i=0
    @i       // 18
    M=0

    // code continue 
(LOOP)
    // if (i==n) goto END
    @i
    D=M
    @n
    D=D-M
    @END
    D;JEQ

    // RAM[arr+i] = -1
    @arr
    D=M
    @i
    A=D+M //RAM[arr+i] -- new M
    M=-1

    // i++
    @i
    M=M+1

    @LOOP
    0;JMP

(END)
    @END
    0;JMP
```

- Variables that store memory addresses like *arr* are called pointers. 
- Hack pointer logic: 
    - whenever we have to access memory using a pointer , we need an instruction like `A=M` , something that comes from some memory register.
