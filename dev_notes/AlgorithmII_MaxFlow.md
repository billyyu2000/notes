## Mincut problem

- Input
    - An edge-weighted digraph, source vertex s, and target vertex t
    - each edge has a positive capacity
- Def.
    - A **st-cut (cut)** is a partition of the vertices into two disjoint sets, with s in one set A and t in the other set B. 
- Def.
    - Its **capacity** is the sum of the capacities of the edges from A to B.

### Mincut application

- **"Free world" goal** 
    - Cut supplies (if cold war turns into real war).

## Maxflow problem

- Input. 
    - An edge-weighted digraph, source vertex s, and target vertex t.
    - each edge has a positive capacity
- Def.
    - An **st-flow (flow)** is an assignment of values to the edges such that:
        - Capacity constraint: 0 ≤ edge's flow ≤ edge's capacity.
        - Local equilibrium: inflow = outflow at every vertex (except s and t).

![](../imgs/AlgorII_max_flow.png)

- Def. The **value** of a flow is the inflow at t.
    - we assume no edge points to s or from t 
    - show as the previous picture, the value = 5 + 10 + 10 = 25.
- **Maximum st-flow (maxflow) problem**
    - Find a flow of maximum value.

## Maxflow application

- **Soviet Union goal**
    - Maximize flow of supplies to Eastern Europe.

## Summary

- Input. A weighted digraph, source vertex s, and target vertex t. 
- Mincut problem. Find a cut of minimum capacity.
- Maxflow problem. Find a flow of maximum value.
- Remarkable fact. These two problems are dual!

## Ford-Fulkerson algorithm

- Initialization. Start with 0 flow. 
    - all edges has 0 flow.
    - the value is 0.
- Idea: increase flow along augmenting paths
    - **Augmenting path**: Find an undirected path from s to t such that:
        - Can increase flow on forward edges (not full).
        - Can decrease flow on backward edge (not empty). ?
