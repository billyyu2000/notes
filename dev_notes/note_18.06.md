In n dimensions space, each equation produces an (n-1) dimemsional "plane" in n dimemsions. Assuming all goes well , every new "plane" (every new equation) reduce the dimension by 1.

At the end, when all n planes are accounted for, the intersection has dimension zero. It's a point , it lies on all planes, and its coordinates satisfy all n equations. It's the solution!

## 2. Elimination

<h2 id="37ce2a99728857da54756961009fe633"></h2>

### Elimination   

- Base operations:  
    1. row exchange   
    2. subtracting multiples of a row from the low above.

**GAUSSIAN ELIMINATION** starts by subtracting multiples of the first equation from the other equations. 

Breakdown of Elimination: 0 in pivot position , then do row exchange , by definition, **pivots cannot be zero**.
 
<h2 id="3377dc23ba4243098066d43864323ef8"></h2>

### Back-Substitution 


One good way to write down the forward elimination steps is to include the right-hand side as an extra column, this matrix [A |b] is an augmented matrix.

[A |b] ==elim==> [U |c] ==> Ux=c

U is a triangular matrix, and then we can use **back-substitution** to get the solve.
    
<h2 id="d890c325530f9d6ea581e8a1991bb8d7"></h2>

### Elimination Matrices

- EA = U
- subtract 3 x column1 from column2
    - elementary matrix: E₂₁
    - 
    ```
    ⎡  1 0 0⎤
    ⎢ -3 1 0⎥

## 3. Matrix multiplication

- associative

- distributive
    - A(B+C) =AB+AC and (B+C)D=BD+CD

### Matrix multiplcation (4 ways) :  A * B = C

1. regular way
    - row·column, dot product
2. column way 
    - columns in C , are combinations of columns of A 
    - that is , A * column of B ,  generates  a column in C 
3. row way
    - rows of C , are combinations of rows of B
    - that is , row of A * B , generates a row in C
4. 4th way
    - sum of (columns of A) * (rows of B) 
    - column * row , generates a big matrix 
    - `sum( Cn*Rn )`

### Inverse of A , AB, Aᵀ
    
- A is not invertible if you can find a non-zero vector that Ax = 0
    - Ax = 0 means some combination of columns gives 0, they contribute nothing. 
- (AB)⁻¹ = B⁻¹A⁻¹
- AA⁻¹ = I 
    - => (A⁻¹)ᵀAᵀ = I

###  Gauss-Jordan / find A⁻¹

- how to find A⁻¹?
    - A * *column j of A⁻¹* = *column j of I* 
    - each time we solve a Ax=i , we get a column of A⁻¹.
- Gauss-Jordan
    - slove n equations at once.
    - Instead of stopping at U and switching to back-substitution , it continues by subtracting multiples of a row *from the low above*.
        - step 1: forward elimination
        - step 2: creating zeros above the pivots
        - last step: divided the rows by their pivots 
    - eliminate on long matrix [AI] , and get [IA⁻¹]
    - 为什么 经过消元后，就能得到A⁻¹嗯 ?
        - E*[AI] = [I?] 
        - E*A=I => E=A⁻¹ => E*[AI]=[IA⁻¹]

### Section 3.1 Vector Spaces and Subspaces

- The begining of Linear Algebra
- All vector subspace have to go through the origin.
- if S and T are both subspace, S∩T is a subspace.
    - why? suppose I take a couple of vectors that are in the intersections, why is the sum also in the intersection? 
        - if V and W are 2 vectors in both S and T , then 
        - V+W is in S , and V+W is in T.   that is  , V+W is in both S and T as well. 
        - and the same to cV , cW .
        - so that , V+W must in S∩T.

## 6. Column Space C(A)

<h2 id="6b209870f2238fe90b6a06eacf3352f4"></h2>

### Column Space of A
 
- The column space contains all linear combinations of the columns of A.
- column的长度j  决定了 A的column space 是 Rʲ 下的一个 subspace.
- Does Ax=b has a solution for every b ? 
    - yes only if b is a combination of the colunmn, that is, b is a vector in the column space.

<h2 id="aae362f830f86beea7700082eba79028"></h2>

### Null Space of A 

- Totally different space. it contains all solutions **x** to Ax = 0.
- The dimension of N(A) is determined by number of columns. 
- Why solutions to Ax=0 always give a subspace ?
    - That is , if Av=0 and Aw=0,  A(v+w) must be 0.
    - A(v+w) = Av + Aw = 0 
- Q: Ax = b ,  is the solutions of x give a subspace ?
    - A: **No**. it doesn't go through the origin.


<h2 id="a036b682183a90d2f1fbe10ce6a5bb86"></h2>

## 7. Special Solution  Ax=0

<h2 id="b5352408af1619a3d4c23bc24b7a9be1"></h2>

### Computing the nullspace (Ax=0)

The algorithm is elimination, but extended to the rectangular case (and won't carray b), where we have to continue even if there's zeros in the pivot position, we go on.

The result, let's call it U,  is a echelon matrix.

**Rank** of A = number of pivots

To solve Ax=0, really I'm solving Ux=0.

PS: The only operation not required by our example, but needed in general, is row exchange.

<h2 id="fe178efd74327aee4c4fb7261a34154b"></h2>

### Pivot variables -- free variables

when you get the echelon matrix, for free variables, you can assign any value, and then you just to compute the value of pivot variables,  so that you get a vector, a special solution for Ux=0.

if it have n free variables, you can find n vectors, n special solutions, those vectors span the null space.

That is , the null space contains exactly all the combinations of the special solutions. And how many special solutiosn there ? There's one for every free variable.  How many free variables ?  n-Rank !  (here, n means number of xᵢ in solution).



<h2 id="2913817abf898dbe3ad9d3e5e39e3026"></h2>

### Special Solutions -- rref(A) = R

Take a more step from U ,  making 0 above and below pivots, and making pivots = 1 by dividing pivot on each row . (PS. zero above the pivot column , not needed for free column)

Then you get reduced row echelon form R.  Matlab will do it immediately with `rref(A)`. 

R got all the information as clear as can be.  

Reduced row echelon form have the same null space as the original matrix. That is the solution to Rx=0  is as same as the solution to Ax=0 , or Ux=0.

PS. if A is invertible, then rref(A) = I.

<details>
<summary>
Example:
</summary>

```
octave:2> A
A =

    1    2    2    2
    2    4    6    8
    3    6    8   10

octave:3> rref(A)
ans =

   1.00000   2.00000   0.00000  -2.00000
   0.00000   0.00000   1.00000   2.00000
   0.00000   0.00000   0.00000   0.00000
```

But how can we get solution directly from the R form ?

From the pivot column, we get a identity matrix, form the free columns we get the free matrix.

```
octave:4> I = [1 0 ; 0 1]
I =

   1   0
   0   1

octave:5> F = [2 -2 ; 0 2 ]
F =

   2  -2
   0   2
```


The typical R form is

```
⎡ I F⎤
⎣ 0 0⎦
```

Now we gonna to create a 'nullspace matrix' N , which columns are the special solution, so that RN=0.

So what N will do the job ?

```
⎡ -F⎤
⎣  I⎦
```

That is ,

```
Rx = 0  

=>

[I F]·⎡ x_pivot⎤ = 0
      ⎣ x_free ⎦

=>

x_pivot = -F * free_variables

    P P     -2  2    -2  2
N = F F =>   F  F =>  1  0
    P P      0 -2     0 -2
    F F      F  F     0  1
```



---

```
R =

   1   0   1
   0   1   1
   0   0   0
   0   0   0
```

What's the x?  The x has a identify, it's only a single number 1, bt its the identify matix in free part. And what does it have in the pivot variables ?  [-1;-1]
 
x = c·[ -1;-1;1 ]

## 8. Solve Ax=b 


<h2 id="9de0ef58d914b04f049388c958ac1a74"></h2>

### Complete solution of Ax=b

To solve Ax=b,  we create an augmented matrix [A |b].

Solvability condition on b: b had to be in the column space C(A).

To find complete solution to Ax=b.

1. one particular solution 
    - set all free variables to 0, and then solve Ax=b for the pivot variables.
2. add any x in the nullspace.

x = x<sub>p</sub> + x<sub>n</sub> , this pattern through all of mathematics, because it shows up everywhere.

x<sub>n</sub> is a subspace, but x<sub>complete</sub> is not.  x<sub>complete</sub> is like a subspace, but it's been shifted, away from the origin, it doesn't contain 0, since it must go through x<sub>p</sub> .


<h2 id="8912c5512db9003e5c8ce07b7ff36a88"></h2>

### Recap

- Spanning involves the column space, and independence involves the nullspace.
    - To decide if b is a combination of the columns, we try to solve Ax = b.
    - To decide if the columns are independent, we solve Ax = 0.

### Spanning a space

The space consists of all combinations of those vectors.

<h2 id="e85643186cee77ad9ac05f9f5f251c51"></h2>

### BASIS and dimension

BASIS for a space is a sequence of vectors with 2 properties.

1. they are independent
2. they span the space.

Dimension of a space is the number of space basis.

**Subspace also have basis**.

rank(A) = #pivot columns = dimension of C(A) (PS. NOT the dimension of matrix) .

dim(C(A)) = r
dim(N(A)) = #free variables = n-r

A 和 Aᵀ 的 r 相等。

---

- You must notice that the word "dimensional" is used in two different ways.
    - We speak about a four-dimensional vector, meaning a vector in R⁴.
    - Now we have defined a 4D subspace;
        - an example is the set of vectors in R⁶ whose first and last components are zero.
        - i.e. (0, 5, 1, 3, 4, 0)
- We never use the terms "basis of a matrix" or "rank of a space" or "dimension of a basis."  These phrases have no meaning.

### Four Fundamental Subspace 

A is mxn

subspace | vector in  | dimemsion

  C(A) |   Rᵐ  | r
  N(A) |   Rⁿ |  n-r
Row Space C(Aᵀ) |  Rⁿ  | r 
Left Null Space N(Cᵀ)  |  Rᵐ |  dim=m-r

- why we call N(Cᵀ) left null space ?
    - Aᵀy = 0  ==>  yᵀA = 0ᵀ 
- elimination:
    - Elimination preserve the row space. so R and A have different colum space, but same row space.

### New vector space !

All 3x3 matrices !!  we called M. 

Every 3x3 matrix is one of my "vectors". They are vectors in my vectors space because they obey the rules. 

dim(M) = 9 !

Subspaces of M :

- upper triangulars
    - dim(U) = 6
- symmetric matrices
    - dim(S) = 6
- diagonal matrices  D 
    - dim(D) = 3

now D is a subspace. The dimension of D is 3. for example, you can shoose such 3 basis:

```
   1   0   0
   0   0   0
   0   0   0

   0   0   0
   0   3   0
   0   0   0

   0   0   0
   0   0   0
   0   0   7
```

### Rank one matrices

A = uvᵀ

We'll be interested in rank 1 matrices. Later we'll find, ok, their determinant, their eigen values, that'll be interesting. 

Rank 1 matrices are like the building blocks for all matrices. And actually maybe you can guess, if I took a 5x17 matrix of rank 4, then it seems pretty likely , and it's true , that I could break that 5x17 matrix down as a combination of rank 1 matrices , -- I need 4 rank 1 matrices. The rank 1 matrices are the building blocks.

Q: S = all v in R⁴ with v₁+v₂+v₃+v₄=0

A: S = null space of A=[1 1 1 1]

rank(A) = 1 = r,  dim(N(A)) = n-r .

### Small graph


Graph = { nodes , edges }

Every peaple is a node, there is an egde between 2 peaples if they are frinds. The question for that graph is how many steps does it take to get from anybody to anybody ? What 2 peaple are furthest apart in this friendship graph.

### Graphs of Networks

Graph = { nodes , edges }


Loops in directed graph correspond linear dependence. 

Usually graph is a very sparse matrix.

Directed graph matrix is always column dependent ? Ax=0

电路图: x=x1,x2,x3,x4...  potential at node.  normally we need fix one node , say, connect it to ground, so that the column represent that node disappear.  

Aᵀy = 0.  currency y1,y2,y3,y4,y5 on edges.


- #loops = #edges - ( #nodes - 1 )

this is, #nodes - #edges + #loops = 1 , it's Euler's formula.

<h2 id="6f2c485c71fb691471a44db33644095c"></h2>

### Orthogonal vectors and subspaces

Subspace S is orthogonal to subspace T , means every vetor S is orthogonal to every vector in T.  

If S is orthogonal to T, then they intersect only at 0 vector. 

Blackboard wall is **NOT** orthogonal to the floor.

### null space ⟂  row space 

why ?

beause Ax=0,  *each row*·x = 0.  

nullspace and row space are orthogonal **complements** in Rⁿ.  That is, nullspace contains **all** vectors ⟂ row space.

<h2 id="1381809db6ebf7c77b7a83e941330b8d"></h2>

### N(AᵀA) = N(A)

Solve Ax=b when there is no solution.

AᵀA:  nxn, symmetric, (AᵀA)ᵀ = AᵀA, 

AᵀAx = Aᵀb

AᵀA is often invertible, but not always.  Since N(AᵀA) = N(A) , so AᵀA is invertible exactly if the column of A are independent, that is N(A)=0.

P = aaᵀ/(aᵀa)
</summary>

how to calculate the vector p , which is vector b projects on vector a ?

p must be some multiple of a ,  p = xa.  The error vector e = b - p  = b - xa   since e ⟂ a , 

so  aᵀe = aᵀ(b-xa) = aᵀb - xaᵀa = 0 

=>  xaᵀa = aᵀb.   => x = aᵀb/(aᵀa) 

p = a·aᵀb/(aᵀa)   => P = aaᵀ/(aᵀa) 

</details>

rank(P) = 1 ,    key property: Pᵀ=P , P²=P 

To calculate p, here is a trick:  associate (aᵀb) first to avoid yield a matrix: p = aᵀb/(aᵀa)·a .


<details>
<summary>
Why project ?
</summary>

- Because Ax=b may have no solution. 
- Ax has to be in the column space , but b may not in column space.
- So I change b to the closest vector in the column space. 
- So I solve Ax = p instead, where p is the projection of b onto the **column space**.

P = A(AᵀA)⁻¹Aᵀ

project onto a place , span with independent vector a1 and a2.  that is , the place is the column space of A=[a1 a2]

The crucial fact is that , e=(b-p) ⟂ the plane, and the p has to be the combination of columns Ax.

p = Ax̂ . 

Now the problem is to find the right combination of the columns so that the error vector is is perpendicular to the plane. 

Find x̂, so that, a₁ᵀ(b - Ax̂) = 0 , and a₂ᵀ(b - Ax̂).  that is 

Aᵀ(b - Ax̂) = 0.

now we know e is in N(Aᵀ), that is saying **e is ⟂ C(A)**.

rewrite the equation :

AᵀAx̂ = Aᵀb.    So the sulution is x̂ = (AᵀA)⁻¹·Aᵀb. 

P = A(AᵀA)⁻¹Aᵀ . 

</details>

why I can not expand the euqation to AA⁻¹(Aᵀ)⁻¹Aᵀ = I  ?  becuase A is not a square matrix, it does not have an inverse. 


- Pᵀ=P ,  inverse of symmetric  is still symmetric.
- P²=P

### Projection Matrix

P = A(AᵀA)⁻¹Aᵀ 

- if b in column space , Pb = b .
    - so Pb = A(AᵀA)⁻¹Aᵀ·Ax = AIx = b 
- if b ⟂ column space ,  Pb = 0 .  
    - ( Mathematical vector is through zero vector )  
    -  what are bs ⟂ column space  ?
        - Those are the vectors in the null space of Aᵀ.
        - so Pb = A(AᵀA)⁻¹Aᵀ·b = A(AᵀA)⁻¹·0 = 0 

Ok now you see what happens if we use our formular. So geometrically what we're seeing is we're taking a vector , we've got the column space, and perpendicular to that is the null space of Aᵀ.

And our typical vector b is out here, and what we're doing is we're projecting it to p in column space, and to e in N(Aᵀ). 


![](../imgs/la_1806_peb.png)

- p + e = b . 
    - so p is the project b on C(A)  ,  p = Pb 
    - how do e come out ?  what's the projection matrix ?
        - It's (I-P), it's another projection matrix !  It project to a perpendicular space.  (投影矩阵特有性质?)
        - e = (I-P)b.

Proof: 

suppose AᵀAx = 0.  

Trick:  xᵀAᵀAx=0 =>  (Ax)ᵀ(Ax)=0  => Ax=0. 

(Ax)ᵀ(Ax) is the length of the vector Ax squared,  if it is 0, then Ax must be 0.  But A has independent columns , the only case is x=0 , that is AᵀA is invertible.

Call Q "orthogonal matrix" ONLY when it is square.

Now we're seeing this new class of matrices with orthonormal columns. This is a long name, I'm sorry that I can't just call them orthogonal matrices. 

Maybe orthonormal matrices are good name.

But the convention is  that we only use that word "orthogonal matrix" when it is square.  So in the case when this is a square matrix, that's the case we call it an orthogonal matrix.

- What's special about the case when it's square?  
    - When it's a square matrix, we've got its inverse. 
    - If Q is square, then QᵀQ=I tells us **Qᵀ=Q⁻¹**.

- What's the good of having a Q ? What formula becomes easy.
    - Suppose Q has orthonormal columns, project onto its column space

### Gram-Schmidt  A -> Q

We start with independent vectors and we want to make them orthonormal.

Here comes Gram-Schmidt.

- step :
    0. vector a,b
    1. orthogonal A,B,C  ( Gram )
        - a -> A is ok.
        - b is not ok. I'm looking for a vector , starts with b, but makes it orthogonal to A. B should be the error vector when b projection onto a. 
            - B = b-p= b- Aᵀb/(AᵀA)·A.  B won't be zero since a,b is independent.
        - Now C is the problem.  C has to be perpendicular to both A and B.
            - C = c-p<sub>A</sub>-p<sub>B</sub> = c - Aᵀc/(AᵀA)·A - Bᵀc/(BᵀB)·B
    2. q₁=A/‖A‖ , q₂=B/‖B‖ q₃=C/‖C‖   (Schmidt)

Gram-Schmidt method will keep the same column space. A = QR is the magic formula here. R turns to be upper triangular.  pls see the book one more time.
