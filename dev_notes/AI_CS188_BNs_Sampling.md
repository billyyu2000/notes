# Approximate inference: Sampling 

A way of doing interence really, really fast, any maybe getting the wrong answer.

And this is different than how we normally approach problems in this class. Normally, we have an exact answer. And we're gonna to find it. 

Sampling-based methods, which you can run them as quickly as you want. But if you don't run them long enough, your answer may not be very accurate.



<h2 id="1d07814d12178c958e4233501cb0bdc7"></h2>

## Sampling

- Sampling is a lot like repeated simulation
    - Predicting the weather, basketball games, …
- Why sample?
    - Learning: get samples from a distribution you don’t know
    - Inference: getting a sample is faster than computing the right answer (e.g. with variable elimination)
        - We're going to go to our Bayes net, in which we know all of the probabilities. But we're going to sample anyway. 
        - When you sample in a network that you already know, it looks like simulation. You walk along the network, and you say, hmm if this happened, let's see what would happen at this variable. And you slip some coins. And you get a sample out that is a sort of probabilistic simulation.
        - And in this case, the reason you're getting a sample is not because you don't actually know or are not able to compute the underlying probabilities. It's because sampling turns out to be faster than computing the right answer through brute force.

- Basic idea
    - Draw N samples from a sampling distribution S
        - and we get to define the sampling distribution.
    - Compute an approximate posterior probability
        - inside those samples, which are all events that look like outcomes of S, and you're going to compute an approximate posterior probability. Whatever query you're trying to answer, you'll compute it over you samples.
    - Show this converges to the true probability P


--- 

- Sampling from given distribution
    - Step 1: Get sample *u* from uniform distribution over \[0, 1)
        - E.g. random() in python
    - Step 2: Convert this sample *u* that lies in \[0,1) interval  into an outcome from the distribution that we want a sample from

---

C | P(C)
--- | --- 
red | 0.6
green | 0.1
blue | 0.3

---
 
- Example 
    - 0 ≤ u ≤ 0.6, → C = red
    - 0.6 ≤ u ≤ 0.7, → C = green
    - 0.7 ≤ u ≤ 1 , → C = blue
    - If random() returns u = 0.83, then our sample is C = blue
    - E.g, after sampling 8 times:
        - 5 reds , 2 blues , 1 green 
        - so what's the probability of blue ?  2/8 = 0.25 , that's our estimate of the probability of blue give this set of samples. 
        - Why would I ever want to do this? Well I basically wouldn't, right? I already know the probability. For this 1D single variable, I wouldn't actually have much useful sampling from this known distribution. However, in a Bayes net, there is a useful sampling from the entire network. Because listing all the outcomes is too expensive, even if I can create them given infinite time.

## Sampling in Bayes’ Nets

- Prior Sampling
- Rejection Sampling
- * Likelihood Weighting
- * Gibbs Sampling

In the order from simple to complex. Often you want end up using those last 2. 

<h2 id="d9850ac369194d66ab390de368f1cf63"></h2>

## Prior Sampling 

![](../imgs/cs188_BNs_sampling_prior_sampling.png)

We have a BNs, and we want to generate samples of the full joint distribution ,but without building full joint distribution. 

![](../imgs/cs188_BNs_sampling_prior_sampling_1st_sample.png)

Given time, I know how to create the whole joint distribution. So I could do that right now. I could ask you, hey, what's the probability that it's cloudy, there's a sprinkler, it's rainy, but the grass is dry? We can compute that right now by multiplying a bunch of conditional probabilities together.

We're going to do something similar to that. Instead of computing an entry of the joint distribution, we are going to create an event which is an assignment to these 4 variables. But we're going to create it by walking along the Bayes net.


- ordering: C → S → R → W , or  C → R → S → W 
- we start with the 1st variable in the ordering **C** 
    - we generate the number in `[0,1)` , then map it to +c , or -c. 
    - this case , we got +c 
- then we pick up next variable , this case *S* 
    - C is already sampled as +c, so we just consider the highlighted part of this table. 
    - again we generate a number, and map it into either +s , or -s
    - this case , we got -s
- next we have to proceed with R 
    - we can not proceed W yet, because W depends on both S and R 
    - this case , we got +r 
- Now we can sample W 
    - this case , we got +w 
    - this generated our first sample from this BNs.   +c,-s,+r,+w
- repeat this process , and build up a set of samples from this BNs distribution here.
- What's the probability that I'll get the sample +c,-s,+r,+w
    - 0.5 * 0.9 * 0.8 * 0.9
    - If I multiply those together, I can determine the probability of the sample, which is just the probability of this event in the distribution described by the Bayes net.

- algorithm to generate 1 sample : 

```python
// single sample
For i=1,2,...,n
    Sample xᵢ from P(Xᵢ| Parents(Xᵢ))
return (x₁,x₂,...,xn)
```

- Question: are we sampling from the correct distribution ?

---

- This process generates samples with probability:
    - ![](../imgs/cs188_BNs_PS_sampling_distribution.png)
    - S<sub>PS</sub> : sampling distribution *S* using prior sampling 
    - i.e. the BN’s joint probability
- Let the number of samples of an event be
    - N<sub>PS</sub> (x₁,x₂,...,x<sub>n</sub>)
- if the number of samples goes to infinity then the number of samples you get for a particular event divided by N will converge to the actual probability for that event.
    -  ![](../imgs/cs188_BNs_sampling_prior_limit.png)
- I.e., the sampling procedure is ***consistent***.

---

<h2 id="0a52730597fb4ffa01fc117d9e71e3a9"></h2>

### Example 

- We’ll get a bunch of samples from the BN: (let's say we ended up with following samples)
    - +c, -s, +r, +w
    - +c, +s, +r, +w
    - -c, +s, +r, -w
    - +c, -s, +r, +w
    - -c, -s, -r, +w
- If we want to know P(W)
    - We have counts :   +w:4 , -w:1
    - Normalize to get P(W) = `<+w:0.8, -w:0.2>`
    - This will get closer to the true distribution with more samples
    - Can estimate anything else, too
    - What about P(C| +w)?   P(C| +r, +w)?  P(C| -r, -w)?
        - P(+c|+w) = 3/4 , P(-c|+w) = 1/4
        - P(+c|+r,+w) = 1
        - P(-c|-r,-w) : not computable from the samples we have.  
    - Fast: can use fewer samples if less time 
        - what’s the drawback?  the accuracy of course. 
        - 和做概率题一个道理。可以套公式硬算，也可以根据先验概率写程序模拟抽样来计算结果

<h2 id="da3112458f911630996b5661ccd81e9d"></h2>

## Rejection Sampling 

Now we're going to look at a way to speed this up a little bit if we know ahead of time what the queries that were asked.

![](../imgs/cs188_BNs_sampling_reject_sampling.png)

> e.g. P(Shape | Color = Blue)

As the samples come off our conveyor belt, we take a look at them. And if they're the samples we can use, meaning they match our evidence, we keep them. And if they're samples we can't use, we reject them.

- Let’s say we want P(C)
    - No point keeping all samples around
    - Just tally counts of C as we go
        - we know we sampled top down through BNs, so we know once we sampled C and if later all interesting is counting how often we have +c/-c 
        - there's no need to still sample S,R and W. 
        - we just stop sampling after we got C. 
- Let’s say we want P(C| +s)
    - Same thing: tally C outcomes, but ignore (reject) samples which don’t have S=+s
        - when you sampled -s , there is no point in continuing.
        - that sample is going to be going unused when you answer your query 
    - This is called rejection sampling
    - It is also consistent for conditional probabilities (i.e., correct in the limit)

```bash
// single sample 
IN: evidence instantiation
For i=1, 2, …, n
    Sample xᵢ from P(Xᵢ| Parents(Xᵢ))
    If xᵢ not consistent with evidence
        Reject: Return, and no sample is generated in this cycle
Return (x1, x2, …, xn)
```

- Quiz: BNs has 5 randomes, you sampled 5 times, 
    - 4 rejected , 1 accepted . 
    - And that accepted samples satisfy my query , say, eg. P(C=1|B=1,E=1)..
- so what is answer of that query ?
    - 1.0 
    - 在符合 B=1,E=1 的 样本中，计算 C=1的概率


---

<h2 id="c6947b6b4431fade42a12cf65b3c9a80"></h2>

### Sampling Example 

- There are 2 cups
    - The frist contains 1 penny and 1 quarter
    - Then second contains 2 quaters
- Say I pick a cup uniformly at random, then pick a coin randomly from that cup. It's a quarter ( yes!). 
    - What is the probability that the other coin in that cup is also a quarter ? 

- One way to answer this question is to use essentially BNs inference to find the answer
- another way to do it is to just run sampling : 2/3

<h2 id="6e0d79ed12bd0076ebad0fc27629611e"></h2>

## Likelihood Weighting

![](../imgs/cs188_BNs_Sampling_LW.png)

Again, we know the query ahead of time, and see if we can further improve the procedure beyond what we did for a rejection sampling. 
 
- Problem with rejection sampling:
    - If evidence is unlikely, rejects lots of samples
    - Evidence not exploited as you sample
        - if the evidence variable are very deep in your BNs, you might have done all that work 
        - reach all the way to the bottom of you BNs, you sample your evidence variable , you sample it the wrong way , now you reject -- that sample can not use . 
    - Consider P(Shape|blue)
        - Shape → Color
            - ~~pyramid, green~~
            - ~~pyramid, red~~
            - sphere , blue
            - ~~cube, red~~
            - ~~sphere, green~~ 

- Idea: fix evidence variables and sample the rest
    - ![](../imgs/cs188_BNs_Sampling_LW_fix_evidence.png)
    - Now we don't have the problem of throwing out samples, because we make them all blue. That is when we're drawing samples from the network, we don't risk the sample not matching the evidence. We fix it to equal the evidence.
    - Problem: sample distribution not consistent!
    - Solution: weight by probability of evidence given parents
        - you instantiated some shape to be blue, and the probability for blue was 0.2 for that shape 
        - you now weight that particular sample by a factor 0.2. 
        - **No dropping samples, but adding a weight to each sample**. Instead of being rejected, you get a small weight.

<h2 id="3eb57101576ca6e2a3251b14ff38ce8f"></h2>

### Example Likelihood Weighting

![](../imgs/cs188_BNs_Sampling_LW_example.png)

- evidence is +s , +w
- we start with Cloudy , we got +c 
    - weight is 1.0
- next we go to Sprinkler,  it is instantiated to be +s, we have weight P(+s|+c) = 0.1 
    - now weight is 1.0\*0.1 
    - *here, instead of flipping a coin and risking a 90% chance of getting minus sprinkler, I'm going to take the universes where I actually get +sAnd I pretend I'm going into those universes, which means this sample only really represents 10% of the sample that make it to this point*.
- next we look at rain, we sample , we got +r 
    - weight is still 1.0\*0.1
- last is WetGrass , it is instantiated to be +w , we weight it P(+w|+s,+r) = 0.99
    - now the weight is 1.0\*0.1\*0.99 = 0.099
- so this sample +c,+s,+r,+w has weigth 0.099

---

- Quiz2:
    - 5 Likelihood Weighting samples
        - weight 0.32 , satisfy the query P(C=1|B=1,E=1)
        - weight 0.24 , not satisfy the query
        - weight 0.16 , satisfy the query
        - weight 0.32 , satisfy the query
        - weight 0.32 , satisfy the query
    - P(C=1|B=1,E=1) = ?
        - [ 0.24, 0.32 + 0.16 + 0.32 + 0.32 ]
        - normalize: [ 0.17647059, 0.82352941]
        - P(C=1|B=1,E=1) = 0.82352941


<h2 id="6d927b96f874f88bd5461de8ac4b040a"></h2>

## Likelihood Weighting Cont.

```python
// single sample
IN: evidence instantiation
w = 1.0
for i=1, 2, …, n
    if Xᵢ is an evidence variable
        Xᵢ = observation xᵢ for X
        Set w = w * P(xᵢ | Parents(Xᵢ))
    else
        Sample xᵢ from P(Xᵢ | Parents(Xi))
Return (x1, x2, …, xn) , w
```

- Are we still doing the right thing ?  Are we sampling from the right distribution ?
    - Sampling distribution if z sampled and e fixed evidence
    - Now, samples have weights
    - Together, weigthed sampling distribution is consistent.

---

- Likelihood weighting is good
    - We have taken evidence into account as we generate the sample
    - E.g. here, W’s value will get picked based on the evidence values of S, R
    - More of our samples will reflect the state of the world suggested by the evidence
- *BUT*, Likelihood weighting doesn’t solve all our problems
    - Evidence influences the choice of downstream variables, but not upstream ones (C isn’t more likely to get a value matching the evidence)
        - *Likelihood works really well when your evidence is at the top because then everything else that falls out of the network after that, conditions on that evidence naturally.*
        - but things than came before an evidence variable are not influenced by the evidence variable. 
        - so things have come before the evidence variable are still samples from a prior that doesn't involve the evidence 
        - **so it's possible that you are sampling things at the top of your BNs that end up being very inconsistent with what happens at the bottom in terms of evidence.** 
        - so if you always encounter this evidence variable at the very end and it's very unlikely, then you will get samples that are not informative yet. e.g. no burglary no earthquake no alarm, but mary called, john called, this sample comes with a very low weight.
        - You'll have to wait a really long time till you finally sample this really unlikely cause of  this really unlikely observation. When you finally sample that really unlikely cause ,finally we'll have a sample with a high weight and that'll give you a good esimate of the distribution. 

- We would like to consider evidence when we sample every variable
    - leads to Gibbs sampling, which has its own issues, but fixes this problem of wanting your samples to take into account the evidence, regardless of where the evidence is placed in the network.

<h2 id="16169430c0295688db141ebd3163baf5"></h2>

## Gibbs Sampling

In Gibbs Sampling, we don't walk through the network from top to bottom, get a sample, and reset. Instead, we're going to do sort of like iterative improvoment for CSP. We're going to start with a complete assigment, and we're going to tweak it a little bit. The end result is going to be that we take into account evidence upstream and downstream, but there's going to be a price.

![](../imgs/cs188_BNs_Sampling_GS.png)

- *Procedure*: 
    - keep track of a full instantiation x₁, x₂, …, x<sub>n</sub>.   
    - Start with an arbitrary instantiation consistent with the evidence.  
        - *we already account for the evidence, the other variables are arbitrarily instantiated.*
    - Sample one variable at a time, conditioned on all the rest, but keep evidence fixed.  
        - *You're then going to walk to the variables one at a time, round robin, and leave the evidence fixed. But for every non-evidence variable, you will resample just that variable, conditioned on all the reset staying fixed.*
        - *we have a distriution, a conditional distribution , compute that distribution and then sample from that conditional distribution.*
        - *we haven't yet looked at what it takes to compute that conditional distribution but in principle you could compute a conditional distribution for one variable given all other variables being instantiated , and then sample from that.* 
    - Keep repeating this for a long time.
- *Property*: in the limit of repeating this infinitely many times the resulting sample is coming from the correct distribution
    - P( unobserved variables | evidence variables )
    - so we're not going to have to weight samples anymore. We're going to directly get samples from the conditional distribution.  
- *Rationale*: both upstream and downstream variables condition on evidence.
- In contrast: likelihood weighting only conditions on upstream evidence, and hence weights obtained in likelihood weighting can sometimes be very small.  Sum of weights over all samples is indicative of how many “effective” samples were obtained, so want high weight.

### Gibbs Sampling Example: P( S | +r)

We're going to generate one sample from our BNs, Cloudy, Sprinkler, Rain, WetGrass. Our evidence is +r. 

- Step 1: Fix evidence
    - R = +r
    - ![](../imgs/cs188_BNs_Sampling_GS_sample_step1.png)
- Step 2: Initialize other variables 
    - Randomly
        - say we pick +c, -s, -w
    - ![](../imgs/cs188_BNs_Sampling_GS_sample_step2.png)
- Steps 3: Repeat
    - Choose a non-evidence variable X
        - this choice here is also supposed to be random 
        - so you randomly pick one of your non-evidence variables as your current variable , that you're going to update  
    - Resample X from P( X | all other variables)
        - Note: **It is not your Bayes Net**. Your Bayes Net has P( X | it's parents )
    - ![](../imgs/cs188_BNs_Sampling_GS_sample_step3.png)
        - we picked S , we uninstantiated it
            - so we compute the conditional distribution for S : P(S|+c,+r,-w) 
                - this distribution can answer some query very efficiently 
            - sample from that distribution ,  and we happen to sample +s 
        - again, we randomly pick C 
            - we compute the conditinal distribution for C : P(C|+s,+r,-w) 
            - sample from that distribution ,  this case we got +c 
        - now we uninstantiate W 
            - we compute the conditinal distribution for W : P(W|+s,+c,+r) 
            - sample from that distribution ,  this case we got -w 
        - keep going 
            - we can look at properties of your BNs, you can infer how long -- how many steps --  you might need to sample
            - Unlike Prior Sampling, here every sample you get looks exactly the same as the previous one. The samples are now highly correlated. 
            - If we grab a sample, and we do this thing for a long time, and we grab another sample, and then we rotate around robin for a while, and grap another sample ...  If we wait long enough between samples, then the correlations reduce, and we're grabbing samples from the joint distribution over all non-evidence variables conditioned on the evidence.

This is just giving you the very basic idea of how Gibbs Sampling works. And you can make it work this way , but if you used it in practice , you'd want to use a lot of methods to make it more efficient.

### Efficient Resampling of One Variable

![](../imgs/cs188_BNs_Sampling_GS_sample_efficient_resample.png)

- Sample from P(S | +c, +r, -w)
    - ![](../imgs/cs188_BNs_Sampling_GS_sample_efficient_resample2.png)
    - a) The numerator came from the Bayes net formula. And the denominator is the exact same thing, but summed over S.
- Many things cancel out – only CPTs with S remain!
- More generally: only CPTs that have resampled variable need to be considered, and joined together
    - b) You take all the terms that mention S, you assign them, and then you normalize over all the different values of S.  The whole reset of the network doesn't matter.
- It's not so bad.

### Further Reading on Gibbs Sampling

- Gibbs sampling produces sample from the query distribution P( Q | e ) in limit of re-sampling infinitely often
- Gibbs sampling is a special case of more general methods called Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods 
    - Metropolis-Hastings is one of the more famous MCMC methods (in fact, Gibbs sampling is a special case of Metropolis-Hastings) 
- You may read about Monte Carlo methods – they’re just sampling

    1. -r, +t
    2. +r, +t
    3. +r, +t
