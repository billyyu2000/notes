## limit of  sinx / x

<h2 id="ad4e9bc62cea4aecede40005fb701b5a"></h2>

###  f(x) = sinx / x , 求 lim x→0

f(1) = 0.8414...
f(0.1) = 0.998...
f(0.01) = 0.99998...
...
f(0.000001) = 0.9999999999 ...

Is the limit 1 ?

It's just a idean, we don't yet have a rigorous argument. 

Here's a sketch of a more rigorous argument that the limit of sinx/x , as x approaches 0 , is equal to one.

```
cosx < sinx/x < 1
```

is true if x close to 0 but not 0. 

**Squeeze theorum**

```
g(x)≤f(x)≤h(x) , x near a 
lim g(x) = lim h(x) = L
then lim f(x) = L 
```

![](../imgs/CalculusOne_squeezed_theorum.png)


<h2 id="4483c04fa3ccf44c111cde358f218561"></h2>

### limit of product

if lim<sub>x→a</sub>f(x) = L , 

   lim<sub>x→a</sub>g(x) = M , then

   lim<sub>x→a</sub>(f(x)·g(x)) = L·M


<h2 id="2b2077c392ecb1166a2447a64365cf3e"></h2>

### lim<sub>x→3</sub> x/(x-3) 

我们不应该除以0， 实际上我们也并没有除以0. 我们实际上只是除以了一个接近0的数。而当我们除以一个接近0的数的时候，会发生什么呢？ 如果分母是一个很小的正数，会得到一个很大的正数，如果分母是接近0的负数，会得到一个很大的负数。 这意味着该极限应该 既接近于 很大的正数，又接近一个很大的负数。这个数不可能接近任何固定的值。

注意：这里分子极限为3，  根前面的 sinx / x  不一样， sinx/x 是 0/0型极限。

lim<sub>x→1</sub> (x²-1)/(x-1) = lim<sub>x→1</sub> (x+1)(x-1)/(x-1) = lim<sub>x→1</sub> (x+1) 

PS. `(x+1)(x-1)/(x-1)`  and `(x+1)` not the same function, 一个在 x=1 处 没定义， 一个在 x=1处有定义。 **But the limit doesn't care**. 极限只取决于 1 附近的函数值。 而在 1附近，这两个函数实际上是一样的。

### Continuity

<h2 id="5573e33b0dfdea6caa96ddf3f7165cfd"></h2>

#### One-Sided Limit:

![](../imgs/CalculusOne_one_side_limit.png)

- If lim<sub>x→a⁺</sub>f(x) != lim<sub>x→a⁻</sub>f(x) , then lim<sub>x→a</sub>f(x)  does not exist.
- if lim<sub>x→a⁺</sub>f(x) =  lim<sub>x→a⁻</sub>f(x) = L,  then lim<sub>x→a</sub>f(x)  = L .

---

<h2 id="fb5871c79f8440fc2a2836470cdba81f"></h2>

####  Continuous:

f(x) is continuous at *a* , means that input near *a* are sent to outputs near f(a). 

more precise :  

- f(x) is continuouse at *a* means that lim<sub>x→a</sub>f(x) = f(a).  That is:
    - f(x) is defined at x=a
    - lim<sub>x→a</sub>f(x) exists
    - lim<sub>x→a</sub>f(x) = f(a)

---

<h2 id="1a8e4c42735dd5a29342c3b0badaa173"></h2>

#### Intermediate Value Theorem

- Suppose f(x) is continuous on [a,b] , and y is between f(a) and f(b).
- Then , there is an x between a and b  , so that f(x) = y .
- 既： [f(a), f(b)] 之间随机选取一个值 y,  应该存在对应的 x ，使得 f(x) = y.

### Infinity

---

<h2 id="589b6a791407525e9ab8f6723184c6a5"></h2>

#### Why is there an x so that f(x) = x

- f(x) cts on [0,1],  0 ≤ x ≤ 1 ; Then there is an x , 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 , and f(x) = x. 
- 称这个点 (x, f(x)) 为函数的不动点
- Proof:
    - g(x) = f(x) - x is cts
    - g(0) = f(0) - 0 ≥ 0
    - g(1) = f(1) - 1 ≤ 0
    - by IVT , find x  , so that g(x) = 0, that is f(x) - x = 0 => f(x) = x.

- 应用：
    - f(x) = cosx

<h2 id="31d71cf51302b193ce93c8b285844bb6"></h2>

#### What means lim<sub>x→a</sub>f(x) = ∞ ?

- f(x) is as large as you like , if provide x is close enough to a.


- 极限不存在 case 
    - 极限无穷大 
    - 左右极限不相等
    - 在正负无穷之间来回震荡
- 极限无穷大 是 极限值收敛于无穷。但左右极限不等、震荡仍判定为极限不存在。

<h2 id="78a1c1c2fa16d034391c0bdd36f154fe"></h2>

#### What means lim<sub>x→∞</sub>f(x) = L ?
    
- f(x) is as close as you want to L , provided x is large enough.

- 求 lim<sub>x→∞</sub> 2x/(x+1) 
    - 这里无法再使用 商的极限法则，因为分子分母的极限都不存在
    - 但是可以 通过 分子分母都 乘上 1/x 来求解， 结果为 2.  ( 测试：代入 1000， 10000 ，其结果接近2 )

### What are derivatives

<h2 id="30618b3b44fa316257d07e387759fae5"></h2>

#### definition 

The ***derivative*** of f at the point x is defined to be :

![](../imgs/calculus1_derivative_def.png)

其他等价的定义：

![](../imgs/Calculus1_derivative_def2.png) , or  ![](../imgs/Calculus1_derivative_def3.png)

- If the derivative of f exists at x , we say that the function is **differentiable** at x.
- If the derivative of f exists at x ,  whenever x is between a and b, then we say that f is **defferentiable** on (a,b).
- The **derivative** of f at the point x , is written as f'(x).
    - ![](../imgs/Calculus1_derivative_written.png)

- **Derivative is slope !**

<h2 id="f4d55e88765552127f1f67cba00e367f"></h2>

#### Why is f(x) = |x| not differentiable at x =0 ? 

When I say a function is differentiable , what I really mean is that when I zoom in, the function looks like a straight line, but not  `f(x) = |x|` .

f'(0) = lim<sub>x→0</sub> |h|/h , DNE.

- Why should you care about differentiable function at all ?
    - If a terrible looking function is differentiable , if I zoom in on some point, the thing looks like a straight line. 
    - Calculus is all about replacing the curved objects that we can't understand with straight line , which we have some hope of understanding.

f'(x) = 3x , f(2) = 4,  f(2.01) = ? 

f(2.01) = f(2) + 0.01·f'(2) = 4 + 0.01·6 = 4.06.

### Why would I care to find derivatives ?

<h2 id="233cda2b0da7e06ce36ab30e5002482a"></h2>

#### Why is sqrt(9999) so close to 99.995? 

- √9999 = √(10000-1) ≈ √10000 - 1·(derivate at 10000) = 100 - 1· 1/(2·100) = 100 - 0.005 = 99.995


<h2 id="e89d54795bc4804fe364603cdb6baed4"></h2>

#### What information is recorded in the sign of the derivative ?

```
f(x+h) ≈ f(x) + h·f'(x) 
```

It means that if the sign of f'(x) is negative , f(x+h) is decreasing , otherwise it is increasing.

### How do differentiability and continuity relate ?

#### Why is a differentiable function necessarily continuous ?

- Theorem :  if *f* is differentiable at *a* , then *f* is continuous at *a*.
    - 可微必(原)连续
- Proof:
    - if f'(a) exist , then  lim<sub>x→a</sub> (f(x)-f(a)) = 0·f'(a) = 0 
    - that means  f(x) = f(a) , while lim<sub>x→a</sub> , it is the definition of continuity. 

<h2 id="d20283b049281436b4b7c193d945d561"></h2>

#### 可微分、连续与可导的关系？

- 一元函数：
    - 可导必 连续，连续推不出可导，
    - 可导与可微等价。
- 多元函数：
    - 可偏导与连续之间没有联系，也就是说可偏导推不出连续，连续推不出可偏导。
    - 可微必可偏导，可微必连续，可偏导推不出可微，但若一阶偏导具有连续性则可推出可微。
        - 某点处偏导数存在与否与该点连续性无关.（即使所有偏导数都存在也不能保证该点连续）.
        - 偏导数存在是可微的必要条件,但非充分条件（可微一定偏导数存在,反之不然）； 
        - 偏导数存在且偏导数连续是可微的充分条件,但非必要条件（偏导数存在且(导)连续一定可微,反之不然）.

    - since derivate is just the slope, and inverse function exchange the x axis and y axis, so 
    - if the derivative of *f(x)* is m , then the derivative of *f⁻¹(y)*  = 1/m.  注意：这里 x，y并不相等


```
   f(x) = x² 
=> f'(x) = 2x

   f⁻¹(x) = √x
=> (f⁻¹)'(x) = 1/f'( f⁻¹(x) ) = 1/f'(√x) = 1/(2√x)

          = 1/x
```

```
f(x) = logₐx 
f'(x) = d/dx( logx/loga )
      since loga is constant 
      = 1/loga · d/dx(logx) 
      = 1/loga · 1/x

#### How can L'Hopital Rule help with limits not of the form 0/0 ?

- L'Hopital Rule also works for ∞ / ∞
 
lim<sub>x→∞</sub> (2x²+1)/(3x²-x) =  lim<sub>x→∞</sub> 4x / (6x-1) = lim<sub>x→∞</sub> 4/6 = 2/3

- for 0·∞ ,  try to transform other forms to "0/0" or "∞/∞"

lim<sub>x→∞</sub> (sin(1/x)·x ) = lim<sub>x→∞</sub> sin(1/x) / (1/x) = cos(1/x)·(-1/x²) / (-1/x²) = cos(1/x) = 1

- 1<sup>∞</sup>

- ∞ - ∞

lim<sub>x→∞</sub> ( √(x²+x) -x  ) = lim<sub>x→∞</sub> ( x·( √(1 + 1/x) -1  ) ) 

 now we get ∞·0 form

 = lim<sub>x→∞</sub> ( ( √(1 + 1/x) -1  )/ (1/x ) 

 now it is 0/0 form , we apply L'Hopital's rule 

 = lim<sub>x→∞</sub> 1/(2·√(1 + 1/x)) ·d/dx(1/x) / d/dx(1/x)

 = lim<sub>x→∞</sub> 1/(2·√(1 + 1/x)) = 1/2

#### Why shouldn't I fall in love with L'Hopital

- lim<sub>x→∞</sub> (x+sinx)/x 
- if you L'Hopital rule to solve it, you will get lim<sub>x→∞</sub> (1+cosx) / 1  , that limit does not exist.
- But it indeed has limit :

lim<sub>x→∞</sub> (x+sinx)/x  = lim<sub>x→∞</sub> (x/x + sinx/x) = 1 + lim<sub>x→∞</sub>sinx/x  = 1 



- When you're doing those limit problems , don't forget that you can just algebraically manipulate things. There might be an easier way than bring out L'Hopital .

### What happens if I repeat linear approximation?

- Problem: f'(x) = f(x) , f(0) = 1
- Goal:  f(1) 
 
We can easily get that f(1)=e . But the point here isn't to the say that answer is e. The point is going to be to try to approximate this quantity without actually knowing the value of e. 

```
f(1) ≈ f(0) + 1·f'(0) 
     = 1 + 1·1 = 2
```

2 is a terrible approximation but we can do better. If we can do any approximation once, we can do it a bunch of time. 

```
f(0.5) ≈ f(0) + 0.5·f'(0)
       = 1.5
f(1) ≈ f(0.5) + 0.5·f'(0.5)
     = 1.5 + 0.5·f(0.5) = 1.5 + 0.5·1.5 = 2.25 
```

10 steps are more better !   f(1)

    - f(2h) ≈ f(h) + h·f'(h)
    - f(3h) ≈ f(2h) + h·f'(2h)
    - ...
    - the cool thing here is that I'm using linear approximation in each stage ,and then I'm using the information from previous stage not only to approximate the function's value , but also to approximate the function's derivative. 
    - In the real world peaple don't really use the Euler method so often. 
    - It's sometimes better not to pick a point which is all the way on the left hand side of the interval .
        - sometimes you'll see using the middle point: `f(h) ≈ f(0) + h·f'(h/2)`


- Quiz:
- You are interested in the function f which satisfies the differential equation 
- f'(x) = -0.5x² - 0.5f(x) , and which satisfies f(-3) =0 .
- Use repeated linear approximation (otherwise known as Euler's Method) to approximate the value of this function at x=−1 , using a step size of 1/2

### What does dx mean by itself?

- **dx** means differential 
- **dy** is change in the linearizatioin of y
    - or the linear approximation, or the tangent line aporiximation.
- your **dy**'s had better include a **dx**.

### What is Newton's method?

- The problem:  A "nice" function f  , nice means differentiable
    - Find x so that f(x) = 0 
        - Now in practice, this is way too much to ask for
    - Find x so that f(x) close to 0. 
- We have already done this , using the Intermediate Value Theorem
    -  The downside to this bisection method is just speed, it takes a really long time
- So a different method, called Newton's method, is much faster than this bisection trick

![](../imgs/calculusone_newton_method.png)

 1. just start by making a potentially bad guess : x₀
    - in this case , that's not a very good guess
 2. draw the tangent line to the curve through that point f(x₀)
 3. then my next guess will be wherever that tangent line crosses the x axis 
    - So here would be my next guess x₁
 4. repeat the process.

We're going to start by thinking about this red line.

![](../imgs/calculusone_newton_method2.png)

- the point slope form Of the red line:
    - `y-f(x₀) = f'(x₀)·(x-x₀)`
- Newton's method tells me that I should use that linear approximation to the graph, figure out where the linear approximation crosses the x axis 
    - So to do that , I'm going to set y = 0
    - 0-f(x₀) = f'(x₀)·(x-x₀)
    - that'll tell me where the red line crosses the x axis, if I solve this equation for x
 
```
0-f(x₀) = f'(x₀)·(x-x₀)
        = f'(x₀)·x - f'(x₀)·x₀

f'(x₀)·x₀ -f(x₀) = f'(x₀)·x 

assuming f'(x₀) != 0
  x₀ - f(x₀)/f'(x₀) = x        
```

- so x₁ is this:
    - x₁ = x₀ - f(x₀)/f'(x₀)
- I can now write down the step by step process for Newtons method just using a formula
    1. Initial guess x₀
    2. new guess x₁ = x₀ - f(x₀)/f'(x₀) 
    3. x₂ = x₁ - f(x₁)/f'(x₁)
    4. x₃ = x₂ - f(x₂)/f'(x₂) 
    5. ... **x<sub>n+1</sub> = x<sub>n</sub> - f(x<sub>n</sub> )/f'(x<sub>n</sub> )**
- The problem is that I can't promise you that Newton's method will actually work.

#### What is a root of the polynomial x^5 + x^2 - 1?

- here's the function where I want to find a root
    - f(x) = x⁵ + x² -1 
- I want to find some input that makes this function equal to 0
    - 没有公式可以求 这个函数的根
    - f(0) = -1, f(1) = 1 
    - So there has to be some input between 0 and 1 where this function's output is equal to 0
- f'(x) = 5x⁴ + 2x 
    - x₀ = 1
    - x₁ = x₀ - f(x₀)/f'(x₀)  = 1 - 1/7 = 6/7 
        - f(x₁) = (6/7)⁵ + (6/7)² -1 ≈ 0.197
    - x₂ = x₁ - f(x₁)/f'(x₁)  ≈ 0.812
        - f(x₂) ≈ 0.014
    - x₃ ≈ 0.809
        - f(x₃) ≈ 0.000085
- So
    - the intermediate value theorem promises me that there is a root
    - Newton's method, or this bi-section algorithm permits me to get better and better approximations to that root

#### How can Newton's method help me to divide quickly?

- What if I wanted to calculate 1/b ?
- Newton's method is really a trick for finding zeroes of a function
    - so to approximate 1/b, what I really want to find is a function *f* , so that f(1/b) = 0.
    - There's a ton of different choices that are possible for such a function
        - f(x) = 1/x -b 
- f'(x) = -1/x²

![](../imgs/calculusone_newton_method_1overb.png)

- Then, we'll make this even more concrete. Let's set b = 7 
    - x₀ = 1/10
    - x₁ = 1/10·(2-7·1/10) = 13/100
    - x₂ = 13/100·(2-7·13/100) = 1417/10000
    - x₃ = 14284777 / 100000000
- so 1/7 ≈ 0.14285...
- This method has name: **Newton-Raphson Division**

### What is the mean value theorem?

- Suppose *f* is continuous on [a,b] , and differentiable on (a,b) ; then
- there exists *c* in (a,b) , so that 
- **f'(c) = ( f(b)-f(a) ) / (b-a)**

---

- here is one interpretation:
    - if that function is giving you position , and the input to that function is time
    - so the derivative of that function is velocity
    - then that formula is saying that your average velocity is achieved , at some point, instantaneously
        - ( f(b)-f(a) ) / (b-a) 是平均速度，f'(c) 是瞬时速度
        - 在某个时刻，你的瞬时速度等于 (a,b)的平均速度 
- ![](../imgs/calculusone_mean_value_theorem.png)
    - mean value theorem means the slope of those 2 lines are same.
- The mean-value theorem is often told as a story about somebody driving a car
    - At noon, you're in some city A, and at 1 p.m. You're driving your car and you've arrived in a city B, which is 100 miles away from city A.
    - the Mean Value Theorem tells you that at some point during your journey, your speedometer said 100 miles per hour.

### Why does f'(x) > 0 imply that f is increasing?

- Theorem:
    - Suppose f'(x) =0 on open interval , then *f* is constant on the interval.
    - Suppose f'(x) >0 on open interval , then *f* is increasing.
    - Suppose f'(x) <0 on open interval , then *f* is decreasing.
- using MVT to proof

### Should I bother to find the point c in the mean value theorem?

- The power of the mean value theorem lies not in the fact that you can actually go out and compute the value c
- The power lies in the fact, the mean value theorem tells you that it's possible , that you know there's a value of c out there, without you having actually go and find it.
