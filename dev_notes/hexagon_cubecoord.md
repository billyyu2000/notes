## Cube coordinates

Let's take a cube grid and **slice** out a diagonal plane at x + y + z = 0.

This is a weird idea but it helps us with hex grid algorithms:

1. 3d cartesian coordinates follow standard vector operations: 
    - we can add/subtract coordinates, multiply/divide by a scalar, etc. 
    - We can reuse these operations with hexagonal grids.
2. 3d cartesian coordinates have existing algorithms 
    - like distances, rotation, reflection, line drawing, conversion to/from screen coordinates, etc.
