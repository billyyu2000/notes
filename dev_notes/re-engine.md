# Regex Engine

- Most modern software and programming languages to be using some variation of the Perl Compatible Regular Expression, **"PCRE"**;
- however command-line tools (grep, less, ...) will often use the POSIX flavor (sometimes with an extended variant, e.g. `egrep` or `sed -r`).
- Vim also comes with its own syntax (a superset of what Vi accepts).
